    <tr>
      <td align="center">Atoms are the smallest elements â€“ in this case the basic elements such as colors, line styles, icons, and text</td>
      <td align="center">Molecules are elements that consist of atoms. A Molecule refers to any element that uses the basic colors and lines, for example, an arrow that is red and dashed.</td>
       <td align="center">Organisms are groups of Molecules. This could be grouped elements such as a typical shape with text and connectors, or even a whole diagram.</td>
